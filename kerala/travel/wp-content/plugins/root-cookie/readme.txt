Changes the cookie default path to / (i.e. the whole domain.com not just domain.com/blog) with an option to go across subdomains

== Description ==

If you want to integrate the wordpress authentication magic into another script within your website you may come across authentication issues because your code cannot read the wordpress cookie.

By default the wordpress cookie exactly matches the URL of your installation, this plugin removes any subfolders from the cookie so that your whole domain has access to it.

For Example if you have wordpress installed in http://www.mydomain.com/wordpress/ any php stored in http://www.mydomain.com/mymagiccode/ cannot see the cookie due to browser security. This plugin changes the path to http://www.mydomain.com/ so that any php code on your site can access the cookie, so in our above example http://www.mydomain.com/mymagiccode/checkauthentication.php can now check the cookie to see if you have logged into wordpress.

NEW: Now you can allow cookies to be used across subdomains! Here are some examples that you can now access cookies from:

* http://www.mydomain.com/
* http://test.mydomain.com/
* http://www.mydomain.com/blog/
* http://test.mydomain.com/new/
* http://forum.mydomain.com/getwordpresslogin.php

== Multi-blog Installs ==

It is possible to use this plugin such that if you are logged into one WordPress site, then you are auto-magically logged into the second, but there are some caveats!

1. The Username & Password _MUST_ be the same on Both!
1. The Security Keys http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Security_Keys Need to be the same on Both!
